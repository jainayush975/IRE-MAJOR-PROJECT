## Movies recommendation System

The project is to develop a movies recommendation system. Websites such as redit and imdb have a number of user reviews about various movies. The goal of the project is to use these reviews and develop a model in which a user describes the kind of movie he/she wants to visit and the model will provide top k movies which match the user's query, as result The problem is similar to entity search, considering a entity as an entity, or question answering over multiple long passages as movie recommendation can be made over a sequence of queries. These systems typically have two steps:

1. Retrieval step: Retrieve top-k passages given a query.
2. Comprehension step: Comprehend the answer from the top-k passages retrieved.

## Basic Model

As the problem is similar to entity search, considering a entity as an entity, or question answering over multiple long passages as movie recommendation can be made over a sequence of queries. Basic Model make index of the reviews releated to a query in solr (lucene) and then search the query terms in the index and output top k results.
